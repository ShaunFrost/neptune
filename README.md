# neptune

An Electron application with React and TypeScript. Tailwind is also used as the styling helper.

## Motivation

During job search period, it's easy to be overwhelmed by what we could build to add credibility to our portfolio. Everything starts from a small idea and we build on top of it. Neptune provides you with a offline way to keep yourself on pace to implement those ideas.

## How to?

Neptune is an offline application and uses flat files to store the project related data. Create a folder named **Neptune** in your home directory.

In MAC, type `Command + Shift + H` in the finder to open your home directory.
In Windows, its normally the `C:/Users/<your-username-name>`

Go to the the [release tags](https://github.com/ShaunFrost/neptune/tags) and download the appropriate installers: dmg for mac and exe for windows. Install and voila! Happy hacking!

## Features

1. Create your project blueprint.
2. Jot down your ideas or notes or everything in between in the Notes section.
3. A drawing board to imagine how to structure the project.

## Future work

Add other features that could be helpful in having full control over the whole project building process.
